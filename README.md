Instant payments with PayPal on Google Glass! Google Glass is Google's new wearable computer, but inputting things like your PIN or PayPal email and password is very difficult with something you wear on your head. Our hack allows you to send PayPal payments instantly using PayPal's preapprove API to setup the transaction approval ahead of time, then on Glass all you have to do is say: OK Glass, Make Payment, then swipe through the options for people requesting payments near you or you can send a set amount to someone in your contact book. Easy and instant!
